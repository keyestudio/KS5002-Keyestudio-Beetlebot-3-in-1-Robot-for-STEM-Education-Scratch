# **Catapult**

## 1.  **Description：**
    
    A catapult is a ballistic device used to launch a projectile a great
    distance without the aid of gunpowder or other propellants –
    particularly various types of ancient and medieval siege engines.
    ... We will make a catapult with LEGO building blocks. Equipped with
    servos and gears, the car has LEGO tower used to carry projectiles.
    
    As the servo rotates to a proper angle then push the long arm
    backward a projectile will be launched.

    Build up a few target objects with building blocks(object A, B, C,
    D, E) and keep them in a certain distance away the catapult and
    connect Wifi.
    
    Click ![](media/5f365b2083f264b4ecfc5e68d07df287.png) to make the car to face the object A,
    hold down the button ![](media/0e62c323c0018af1a2824a120d447bda.png)to drive the catapult to
    launch a building block.
    
    Then release the button ![](media/0e62c323c0018af1a2824a120d447bda.png)to make the long arm
    return to the original state. Next, let’s check if the object A is
    hit by the launched block
    
    You can repeat above steps to hit the object B, C and D
