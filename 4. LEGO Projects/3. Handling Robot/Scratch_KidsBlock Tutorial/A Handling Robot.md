# **A Handling Robot**

## 1.  **Description：**
    
    Among many industrial robots, handling robots are undoubtedly
    effective, applied in industrial manufacturing, warehousing and
    logistics, tobacco, medicine, food, chemical and other industries,
    or in post offices, libraries, ports and parking lots. In this
    experiment, we will use LEGO blocks to build a handling robot to
    carry things.
