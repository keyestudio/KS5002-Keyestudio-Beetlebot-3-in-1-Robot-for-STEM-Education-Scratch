## Project 1: 6812 RGB

1.  **Description：**

There are 4 RGB LEDs can be widely used in the decoration of buildings,
bridges, roads, gardens, courtyards and so on by colors adjustment.

In this experiment, we will demonstrate different lighting effects with
them.

2.  **Component Knowledge**

**SK6812RGB:**

From the schematic diagram, we can see that these four pixel lighting
beads are all connected in series. In fact, no matter how many they are,
we can use a pin to control a light and let it display any color. The
pixel point contains a data latch signal shaping amplifier drive
circuit, a high-precision internal oscillator and a 12V high-voltage
programmable constant current control part, which effectively ensures
the color of the pixel point light is highly consistent.

The data protocol adopts a single-wire zero-code communication method.
After the pixel is powered up and reset, the S terminal receives the
data transmitted from the controller. The first 24bit data sent is
extracted by the first pixel and sent to the data latch of the pixel.

    Composed of LED emitting tube diodes, the 8\*8 LED dot matrix are
    applied widely to public information display like advertisement
    screen and bulletin board, by controlling LED to show words,
    pictures and videos, etc.
    
    **2. Knowledge：**

There are different types of matrices, including 4×4, 8×8 and 16×16 and
etc. It contains 64 LEDs.

The inner structure of 8×8 dot matrix is shown below.

![](media/df08c3a7c84497e429ce6fde7253d9b3.jpeg)

Every LED is installed on the cross point of row line and column line.
When the voltage on a row line increases, and the voltage on the column
line reduces, the LED on the cross point will light up. 8×8 dot matrix
has 16 pins. Put the silk-screened side down and the numbers are 1, 8, 9
and 16 in anticlockwise order as marked below.

![](media/6576aff8e8a7fb35335629c2f60de29b.jpeg)

The definition inner pins are shown below:

![](media/4b98c449bae6648d7719a58d9ab2efa7.jpeg)

For instance, to light up the LED on row 1 and column 1, you should
increase the voltage of pin 9 and reduce the voltage of pin 13.

## Project 4: Servo Rotation

1.  **Description：**

There are two servos on the car. We take the servo connected to pin D9
as an example.

The servo is a motor that can rotate very accurately. It has been widely
applied to toy cars, remote control helicopters, airplanes, robots and
other fields. In this project, we will use the Nano motherboard to
control the servo to spin.

2.  **Knowledge：**

![](media/99830768916233a9c5900ac399006c17.png)

Servo motor is a position control rotary actuator. It mainly consists of
a housing, a circuit board, a core-less motor, a gear and a position
sensor. Its working principle is that the servo receives the signal sent
by MCU or receiver and produces a reference signal with a period of 20ms
and width of 1.5ms, then compares the acquired DC bias voltage to the
voltage of the potentiometer and obtain the voltage difference output.

When the motor speed is constant, the potentiometer is driven to rotate
through the cascade reduction gear, which leads that the voltage
difference is 0, and the motor stops rotating. Generally, the angle
range of servo rotation is 0° --180 °

The rotation angle of servo motor is controlled by regulating the duty
cycle of PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) signal. The standard cycle of PWM
signal is 20ms (50Hz). Theoretically, the width is distributed
between 1ms-2ms, but in fact, it's between 0.5ms-2.5ms. The width
corresponds the rotation angle from 0° to 180°. But note that for
different brand motors, the same signal may have different rotation
angles. 

![](media/708316fde05c62113a3024e0efb0c237.jpeg)

In general, servo has three lines in brown, red and orange. The brown
wire is grounded, the red one is a positive pole line and the orange one
is a signal line.

Then the arm of the servo will rotate to 0°, 45°, 90°, 135° and 180°

## Project 5: Motor Driving and Speed Control 

1.  **Description：**

There are many ways to drive motors. This car uses the most commonly
used DRV8833 motor driver chip, which provides a dual-channel bridge
electric driver for toys, printers and other motor integration
applications.

In this experiment, we use the DRV8833 motor driver chip on the
expansion board to drive the two DC motors, and demonstrate the effect
of forward, backward, left-turning, and right-turning.

2.  **Knowledge：**

DRV8833 motor driver chip: Dual H-bridge motor driver with current
control function, can drive two DC motors, one bipolar stepper motor,
solenoid valve or other inductive loads. Each H-bridge includes
circuitry to regulate or limit winding current.

An internal shutdown function with a fault output pin is used for
over-current and short circuit protection, under-voltage lockout and
over-temperature. A low-power sleep mode is also added. Let's take a
look at the schematic diagram of the DRV8833 motor driver chip driving
two DC motors:

## Project 6: Ultrasonic Sensor

There is an ultrasonic sensor on the car. It is a very affordable
distance-measuring sensor.

The ultrasonic sensor sends a high-frequency ultrasonic signal that
human hearing can’t hear. When encountering obstacles, these signals
will be reflected back immediately. After receiving the returned
information, the distance between the sensor and the obstacle will be
calculated by judging the time difference between the transmitted signal
and the received signal. It is mainly used for object avoidance and
ranging in various robotics projects.

### Project 6.1: Ultrasonic Ranging

**1.Description：**

In this experiment, we use an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance and
print the data on a serial monitor.

**2. Knowledge：**

The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses sonar to determine distance to an
object like what bats do. It offers excellent non-contact range
detection with high accuracy and stable readings in an easy-to-use
package. It comes complete with ultrasonic transmitter and receiver
modules.

The HC-SR04 or the ultrasonic sensor is being used in a wide range of
electronics projects for creating obstacle detection and distance
measuring application as well as various other applications. Here we
have brought the simple method to measure the distance with Arduino and
ultrasonic sensor and how to use ultrasonic sensor with Arduino.

![](media/e6f6037071e434febf7090b56ac35802.png)

**Use method and timing chart of ultrasonic module:**

1.  Setting the delay time of Trig pin of SR04 to 10μs at least, which
    can trigger it to detect distance.

2.  After triggering, the module will automatically send eight 40KHz
    ultrasonic pulses and detect whether there is a signal return. This
    step will be completed automatically by the module.

3.  If the signal returns, the Echo pin will output a high level, and
    the duration of the high level is the time from the transmission of
    the ultrasonic wave to the return.

![](media/db430baa07e2e4d9ac9efca1950b953a.jpeg)

![](media/4114885ac4b6214953e3224d8c1d52c4.png)

Time=Echo pulse width, unit: us

Distance（cm）=time/ 58

Distance(inch)=time/ 148

The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor has four pins: Vcc, Trig, Echo and GND.

The Vcc pin provides power generating ultrasonic pulses and is connected
to Vcc/+5V. The GND pin is grounded/GND.

The Trig pin is where the Arduino sends a signal to start the ultrasonic
pulse. The Echo pin is where the ultrasonic sensor sends information
about the duration of the ultrasonic pulse stroke to the Arduino control
board.

## Project 7: Line Tracking Sensor

There are two IR line tracking sensors on the car. They are actually two
pairs of ST188L3 infrared tubes and used to detect black and white
lines. In this project, we will make a line tracking car

### **Project 7.1: Reading Values**

**1.Description：**

In this experiment, we use ST188L3 infrared tubes to detect black and
white lines, then print the data on the serial monitor.

**2. Knowledge：**

**Infrared line tracking:**

The IR line tracking sensor boasts a pair of ST188L3 infrared tubes.
ST188L3 tubes has an infrared emitting diode and a receiver tube. When
the emitting diode emits an infrared signal then received by the
receiving tube after being reflected by the white object. Once the
receiving tube receives the signal, the output terminal will output a
low level (0); when the infrared emitting diode emits an infrared
signal, and the infrared signal is absorbed by the black object, a high
level (1) will be output, thus realizing the function of detecting
signals through infrared rays.

Warning: Reflective optical sensors (including IR line tracking sensors)
shouldn’t be applied under sunlight as there is a lot of invisible light
such as infrared and ultraviolet.

Values detected by the line tracking sensor are shown in the table.

The value will be 1 if detecting black or no objects and the value 0
will appear if detecting white objects.

he detected black object or no object represents 1, and the detected
white object represents 0.

**3. Test Code：**

The line tracking sensors of the PCB board are controlled by GPIO17 and
GPIO16 of the ESP32 baord.

![](media/4eafeaf5bbb9e3f06754b8b9b2b33a59.png)

**4. Test Result：**

Upload the test code to the ESP32 board, power up with a USB cable, open
the serial monitor to click ![](media/5aa7c3468c7015b37236cd95c06280d8.png) and set baud rate to
115200.

Put a black thing under the line tracking sensor of the car and move it,
you will see different indicators light up, and at the same time you
will see the value on the serial monitor.

The sensitivity can be adjusted by rotating the potentiometer. When the
indicator light is adjusted to the critical point of on and off state,
the sensitivity is the highest.

## Project 8: Light Following

There are two photoresistors on the car. They can vary with the light
intensity and send information to the Nano board to control the car.

Photoresistors can determine and conduct the car to move by detecting
light

### Project 8.1: Read Values

1.  **Description：**

In this experiment, we will learn the working principle of the
photoresistor

**2. Knowledge：**

**Photoresistor:**

It mainly uses a photosensitive resistance element whose resistance
varies from the light intensity. The signal terminal of the sensor is
connected to the analog port of the microcontroller. When the light is
stronger, the analog value at the analog port will increase; on the
contrary, when the light intensity is weaker, the analog value of the
microcontroller will reduce. In this way, the corresponding analog value
can reflect the ambient light intensity.

**3. Wire up：**

Through the wiring-up diagram, signal pins of two photoresistors are
connected to A6 and A7 of the Nano board.

For the following experiment, we use the photoresistor connected to A6
to finish experiments. First, let’s read analog values.

the serial monitor to click ![](media/5aa7c3468c7015b37236cd95c06280d8.png) and set baud to
115200.

When the light intensifies, the analog value will get increased; on the
contrary, the analog value will get reduced.

## Project 9: IR Remote Control

Infrared remote controls are everywhere in daily life. It is used to
control various home appliances, such as TV, speakers, video recorders
and satellite signal receivers.

The remote control is composed of an IR emitter, an IR receiver and a
decoding MCU. In this project, we will make a IR remote control car.

### Project 9.1: IR Remote and Reception

**1.Description：**

In this experiment, we will combine the IR receiver and the IR remote
control to read key values and show them on the serial monitor.

2.  **Knowledge：**

**IR Remote Control：**

It is a device with buttons. When the key is pressed, IR signals will be
sent.

Infrared remote control technology is widely used, such as TVs, air
conditioners and so on. And it can control air conditioners and TVs

The infrared remote control adopts NEC coding, and the signal period is
110ms.

The remote control is shown below:

![](media/3c9d76cb0d24d9861811ce2cb0bb6ae4.png)

Infrared (IR) receiver:

It can receive infrared light and be used to detect the infrared signal
emitted by the infrared remote control.

It can demodulate the received infrared light signal and convert it back
to binary, and then transmit the information to the microcontroller.

![](media/3da1969e509f53706643c77d0534eb73.png)

**NEC Infrared communication protocol：**

**NEC Protocol**

To my knowledge the protocol I describe here was developed by NEC (Now
Renesas). I've seen very similar protocol descriptions on the internet,
and there the protocol is called Japanese Format.

I do admit that I don't know exactly who developed it. What I do know is
that it was used in my late VCR produced by Sanyo and was marketed under
the name of Fisher. NEC manufactured the remote control IC.

This description was taken from my VCR's service manual. Those were the
days, when service manuals were filled with useful information\!

**Features**

  - > 8 bit address and 8 bit command length.

  - > Extended mode available, doubling the address size.

  - > Address and command are transmitted twice for reliability.

  - > Pulse distance modulation.

  - > Carrier frequency of 38kHz.

  - > Bit time of 1.125ms or 2.25ms.

**Modulation**

![](media/da33571c6f0afb94b1ec1d91caba3edb.png)

The NEC protocol uses pulse distance encoding of the bits. Each pulse is
a 560µs long 38kHz carrier burst (about 21 cycles). A logical "1" takes
2.25ms to transmit, while a logical "0" is only half of that, being
1.125ms. The recommended carrier duty-cycle is 1/4 or 1/3

**Protocol**

![](media/f970404e7bbfb5711fea5c776f689f3a.png)

The picture above shows a typical pulse train of the NEC protocol. With
this protocol the LSB is transmitted first. In this case Address $59 and
Command $16 is transmitted. A message is started by a 9ms AGC burst,
which was used to set the gain of the earlier IR receivers. This AGC
burst is then followed by a 4.5ms space, which is then followed by the
Address and Command. Address and Command are transmitted twice. The
second time all bits are inverted and can be used for verification of
the received message. The total transmission time is constant because
every bit is repeated with its inverted length. If you're not interested
in this reliability you can ignore the inverted values, or you can
expand the Address and Command to 16 bits each\!

Keep in mind that one extra 560µs burst has to follow at the end of the
message in order to be able to determine the value of the last bit.

![](media/63364daf21e5522c64eb8dfa82f2cef2.png)

A command is transmitted only once, even when the key on the remote
control remains pressed. Every 110ms a repeat code is transmitted for as
long as the key remains down. This repeat code is simply a 9ms AGC pulse
followed by a 2.25ms space and a 560µs burst.

![](media/afea92a3b5cc1aa2457d2b118b157c84.png)

**Extended NEC protocol**

The NEC protocol is so widely used that soon all possible addresses were
used up. By sacrificing the address redundancy the address range was
extended from 256 possible values to approximately 65000 different
values. This way the address range was extended from 8 bits to 16 bits
without changing any other property of the protocol.

By extending the address range this way the total message time is no
longer constant. It now depends on the total number of 1's and 0's in
the message. If you want to keep the total message time constant you'll
have to make sure the number 1's in the address field is 8 (it
automatically means that the number of 0's is also 8). This will reduce
the maximum number of different addresses to just about 13000.

The command redundancy is still preserved. Therefore each address can
still handle 256 different commands.

![](media/2f78d1ce7f001926f6b90ad966796e91.png)

Keep in mind that 256 address values of the extended protocol are
invalid because they are in fact normal NEC protocol addresses. Whenever
the low byte is the exact inverse of the high byte it is not a valid
extended address.

**3.Test Code：**

The IR receiver on the PCB board is controlled by GPIO19 of the ESP32
board.

![](media/c19eedef330e041ac641d73b8c84e90d.png)

**5.Test Result：**

Upload the test code to the ESP32 board, power up with a USB cable, open
the serial monitor to click ![](media/5aa7c3468c7015b37236cd95c06280d8.png) and set to 115200.

Press a key on the IR remote control, you will view a code on the serial
monitor. If FFFFFFFF shows up, just ignore it
